# Cookie Clicker CE
 Cookie Clicker for the TI-84 Plus CE!

I know there's probably already a billion of these, but I haven't found one that works that looks and acts just like the original, so I'm making my own.
This is a work in progress, but the goal is to get it as close to the original as possible

# Building
Building the project is pretty simple, just run `make gfx` then `make`

# Contributing
If you want to help the project, you can either make a pull request or preferably contact **LeNerd46#0316** on Discord (lenerd46)
<br/>We are constantly working on this, so if you make a pull request adding some feature, there's a chance we might've already added
